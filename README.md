# My Portfolio Page

## Description

This portfolio page was created to showcase my work through coding bootcamp (& beyond). So what better way to do just that, then by deploying it to the web?
Was it tricky at first? Yeah, definitely. I wasn't really sure how to do so or what I was even supposed to do for that matter. I just knew what my end-goal was... To build a centralized, easy to see, easy to navigate, user friendly gallery of my work. And I feel like, very simply, I've done just that.
It's like an IKEA for my work. But you don't have to build anything, I've done that part. Just follow along and enjoy.

## Installation

How to use:

In the "Who Am I?" section, you'll find a little 'About me' kinda deal.
In the "What have I done?" section, you'll find exactly that. These are my various projects to date, starting with this very one. Let's see how they grow.
In the "How do you reach me section?", you'll find info on doing so.
