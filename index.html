        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Alright.. So who is this guy in the pic? That's me. Christopher Andrew Carapella.</p>
        <p>The basics? I was born November 11th '95, in New Jersey (Where I've lived most of my life, aside from a couple short stints in Atlanta.) 
            At the moment, I have no pets. I work a lot, I manage to fit this course in as well. I have about a billion hobbies. 
            All of which are typically pretty dangerous... Feel free to ask about them! I love my family, I love my friends, I love this life.
            That being said, I don't take this life easily. I believe in living with purpose and conviction. I believe in being and becoming my best. 
            I think that's plenty for now. Get to know me, you'll learn the rest. </p>
